			<h2>Art</h2>
			<p>For many years as a child, I took art lessons, and recently for the past two years over the summer, I have taught art lessons at studios near me. I enjoy painting the most and more specifically I like watercolor and acrylic. Many of my favorite things to paint include landscapes and still life.</p>

			<h2>Cello</h2>
			<p>I have played cello for many years and enjoy listening to classical music. Wanting to continue playing cello on a consistent basis during college, I joined the University's Chamber Orchestra and have met people who appreciate classical as much as I do. I have even joined a small string ensemble with a few freinds for the upcoming semester.</p>

			<h2>Fishing</h2>
			<p>I love to go fishing in the ponds around my home, as well as exploring new waters when I am traveling. I am drawn to the unpredicatability of fishing and the adventure of exploring new areas I have never fished before. Fishing has taught me a lot about patience and persistence. The feeling of fighting a large fish never gets old.</p>
