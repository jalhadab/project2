## Classes & Relationships
Each student has a background statement, a picture, 3 interests, and a contact box. Each interest has a picture. Each background statement has a major, and a hobby.

## Decisions About Choreography
The navigation element of the site is sorted alphabetically by last name. In the site, names all sorted alphabetically by last name. On everyone's subpage, there's a header with their name, photo, and intro. Below that, there are 2 rows each containing 2 boxes: the first row contains 2 extracurriculars and the second row contains an interest and a contact info box. The extracurricular row is sorted alphabetically, and the second row only has one thing to sort because the contact box is always last.
