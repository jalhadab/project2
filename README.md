## Classes & Relationships
Each student has a background statement, a picture, 3 interests, and a contact box. Each interest has a picture. Each background statement has a major, and a hobby. We mainly focused on our interests and what we do with our free time, both in and out of school.

## Decisions About Choreography
The navigation element of the site is sorted alphabetically by last name. In the index page, students are sorted alphabetically by last name, and the 3 descriptors are also sorted alphabetically. On everyone's subpage, there's a header with their name, photo, and intro. Below that, there are 2 rows each containing 2 boxes: 
- each box in the first row contains an interest, sorted alphabetically
- the second row has one interest and the contact box
