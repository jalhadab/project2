## Classes & Relationships
Each student has a background statement, a picture, 3 interests, and a contact box. Each interest has a picture. Each background statement has a major, and a hobby. We mainly focused on our interests and what we do with our free time, both in and out of school, since we're all either majoring or minoring in computer science so we wanted to highlight our differences.

## Decisions About Choreography
The navigation element of the site is sorted alphabetically by last name. In the index page, students are sorted alphabetically by last name, and the 3 descriptors are also sorted alphabetically. On everyone's subpage, there's a header with their name, photo, and intro. This is the first thing on the page because it's the most important information on the page. Below the intro, there are 2 rows each containing 2 boxes: 
- each box in the first row contains an interest, sorted alphabetically
- the second row has one interest and the contact box
