			<p> I love to go fishing in the ponds around my home, as well as exploring new waters when I am traveling. I am drawn to the unpredicatability of fishing and the adventure of exploring new areas I have never fished before. Fishing has taught me a lot about patience and persistence. The feeling of fighting a large fish never gets old.    </p>
